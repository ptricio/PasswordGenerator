Description: This is a simple password generator application. You can 
generate a random password from 8 - 16 characters long that has lower
and upper case letters, numbers 0-9, and characters. I built this as a 
simple tool for anyone to use that has to make and deal with multiple 
accounts and doesn't want to bother with thinking up new passwords all
the time.

How to use: You will need to download the java JDK, and download the
passwordGenerator.jar file once downloaded you can just click the file
and it will run the program.
